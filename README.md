Projektowanie algorytm√≥w i metod sztucznej inteligencji
# Project 1) Data structures 
A project in which popular STL containers were created from scratch:
- stack
- singly and doubly linked list
- priority queue (implemented with arrays and lists)
# Project 2) Sorting algorithms
A project in which sorting algorithms were created and tested:
- quicksort
- mergesort
- heapsort (with a custom heap implementation)
# Projekt 3) Graph algorithms
The most interesting project in this repository, a graph structure was developed using:
- adjacency list
- adjacency matrix \
And then, shortest path search algorithms were implemented:
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman-Ford algorithm
# Projekt 4) Game with artificial intelligence
Tic-tac-toe game using the MIN-MAX strategy and a graphics library.
